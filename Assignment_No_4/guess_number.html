  <h1>Number Guessing Game</h1>
  <div class="blog-section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Number Guessing Game is a classic coding project for both beginners and experienced web developers. In this game, a secret number is randomly selected by the computer, and the player attempts to guess it within a limited number of tries. Every time a guess is made, feedback is provided—telling the player if the guessed number is too high, too low, or exactly correct[web:26][web:27].
    </p>

    <h2>How Does the Game Work?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The computer randomly selects a number within a chosen range, for example, 1 to 100.</li>
      <li>The player enters guesses and receives hints after each attempt—whether the guess is too high or too low.</li>
      <li>A counter tracks the number of attempts, and the player has a set maximum number of chances to solve the puzzle[web:26].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Build a Number Guessing Game?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It helps you practice working with random numbers in your code.</li>
      <li>You'll gain experience with user input handling and displaying dynamic feedback.</li>
      <li>This project is a fantastic way to learn basic logic, loops, and conditionals in programming[web:31].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making the Game</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Set up an HTML structure with instructions, input fields, and feedback messages.</li>
      <li>Use CSS to style the game for clarity and visual appeal.</li>
      <li>Add JavaScript to generate the random number, check user guesses, and display hints such as "Too High" or "Too Low."[web:26][web:27]</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Learning Benefits</h2>
    <p>
      This simple project is perfect for beginners studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It combines logic, randomization, input validation, and user interface styling in a friendly and memorable way. After making this game, try expanding it with features such as difficulty levels, score tracking, or a leaderboard.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Building a Number Guessing Game is an enjoyable and rewarding way to strengthen your web development skills. It is simple, interactive, and perfect for showing off what you can do with basic coding knowledge. Have fun coding and keep challenging yourself!
